Yes 👍 the LLM can do the mapping itself even if you don’t have pre-written rules — that’s actually one of the main reasons to bring RAG into the workflow.

But there are a few nuances 👇


---

🔑 How LLM Can Map Without Rules

1. Input to LLM:

Samsung Standard CIQ column headers (and optionally some sample rows).

NE Grow template headers.

Prompt: “Map NE Grow fields to Standard CIQ fields or derive them.”



2. LLM Reasoning:

It uses semantic similarity + naming conventions.

CELL_ID ↔ CellId

TAC ↔ TrackingAreaCode

ENBID ↔ combination of MCC, MNC, ENodeB_ID


If it can’t match → it will either guess or leave blank.



3. RAG Enhancement (Why RAG is Better):

If you only rely on LLM, each query is “stateless.”

With RAG, you feed it examples from past confirmed mappings.

This anchors the LLM to real mappings (per operator), reducing hallucinations.

🛠️ Options for You

Option A — Pure LLM (No Rules, No RAG)

Pros: Fast to set up, no prep work.

Cons: Inconsistent, may hallucinate field mappings differently each time.


Option B — LLM + RAG (Recommended)

Build a small KB of:

NE Grow template field descriptions

Operator-specific examples (even if only Telus for now)


Use vector search → retrieve “hints” for each mapping.

Ask LLM to reason using retrieved examples + CIQ data.

Output is more stable and explainable.



---

🔄 Suggested Workflow if You Start With No Rules

1. Load Samsung Standard CIQ + NE Grow template headers.


2. For each NE Grow field:

Ask LLM:

Given these Samsung Standard CIQ columns:
[CellId, TrackingAreaCode, MCC, MNC, ENodeB_ID, ...]

Map to NE Grow column "CELL_ID".
If direct → say "CELL_ID ← CellId".
If derived → explain derivation.
If not found → say "Not Found".



3. Collect mappings into a JSON.


4. Apply transformations with pandas.


5. Save generated NE Grow Excel.


6. Ask user to validate.


7. Save confirmed mappings as rules → build KB → enable RAG.

⚡ Practical Tip

If you have only Telus NE Grow template today, you can bootstrap by asking the LLM to infer the Telus rules directly from CIQ+Template.

That gives you your first KB entry.

Later when Vodafone NE Grow comes, repeat the process.



---

✅ So, short answer: Yes, LLM can directly map CIQ → NE Grow without rules, but:

It’s safer with RAG (to avoid random outputs).

Even without rules, you should still capture the LLM’s output into your KB so you don’t ask it again every time.



---

Would you like me to draft a real Guess API prompt that you can use today to get mappings directly from the LLM when no rules exist?

Mapping rules from Samsung Standard CIQ

Any operator-specific derivations.



Store this in a vector DB (FAISS/Chroma) with metadata:

{
  "operator": "Vodafone",
  "tech": "5G",
  "template": "vodafone_ne_grow_v3.xlsx",
  "mapping_rules": [
    {"NE_GROW": "CELL_ID", "CIQ": "CellId"},
    {"NE_GROW": "TAC", "CIQ": "TrackingAreaCode"},
    {"NE_GROW": "ENBID", "CIQ": "ENodeB_ID"}
  ]
}


---

2. Template Selection

When processing a CIQ:

Parse operator, RAT, and project type from CIQ metadata (already available in Samsung Standard CIQ header).

Query vector DB → retrieve most relevant NE Grow template.

e.g., Telus + NR → select telus_nr_ne_grow_v2.


If multiple candidates found → ask user:
“I found 2 NE Grow templates for Vodafone NR. Which one should I use: v2 (2023) or v3 (2024)?”



---

3. Chunked RAG for LLM Context

Instead of giving full CIQ (thousands of rows):

Split Samsung Standard CIQ into per-site or per-sector chunks.

Process one chunk at a time into NE Grow format.

Append results into final NE Grow Excel.


This way, LLM context length won’t explode.


---

4. Pipeline Flow

1. Upload Samsung Standard CIQ.


2. Extract operator + RAT.


3. RAG → select correct NE Grow template + mapping rules.


4. For each site/sector (chunk):

Apply mapping rules.

Use LLM only if transformation is non-deterministic (e.g., deriving values).



5. Append rows → build final NE Grow.


6. Show summary:

✅ Filled columns

⚠️ Unmapped/missing columns (ask user to confirm).





---

5. Fallback Logic

Direct mapping (deterministic): Done by code (pandas).

Ambiguous/derived mapping: Retrieved via RAG → ask LLM to assist.

Template selection issue: Ask user.



---

👉 This hybrid approach reduces LLM load and ensures reliability across multiple operators.
You basically use LLM as a “reasoning assistant” only when simple pandas mapping isn’t enough.


---

Do you want me to draw an architecture diagram + sample code snippet (Python + FAISS + pandas) showing how:

CIQ → detect operator/RAT

Pick NE Grow template

Map chunk by chunk → Excel


? That way you’ll see the full end-to-end picture.
